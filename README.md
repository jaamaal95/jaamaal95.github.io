**Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Jamal,**

Product Engineer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
I build cross-platform apps using React/React Native.

Currently working at [ShellBeeHaken Ltd.](https://shellbeehaken.com/), as a **Full Stack Software Engineer**

Our team is developing an innovative product called [KriyaKarak Ltd.](https://kriyakarak.com/), which is designed to help young creatives turn their craft into careers.

## About the Project

This site is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped by [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can edit the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
